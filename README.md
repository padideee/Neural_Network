# Neural_Network
Neural Network implementation from scratch for classification task

-  Place the data.pkl containing train, validation and test set in the datapath directory
-  Modify the main appropriately based on the desired: hidden dimensions, activation function, normalization, number of epochs,...
 

- Run:
```bash
$ python NN.py
```

This will do the training and prediction, the result is a dictionary containing the accuracy and loss scores. For some examples of performance on SVHN dataset refer to the notebook: NN_plots.ipynb
